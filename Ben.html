      <h3>Beaded lizard: <br> Heloderma horridum</h3>
        <p>The two best known venomous lizards are the gila monster and the beaded lizard. The venom glands are found in the reptile's lower jaw. The lizard chews its prey and the venom enters the prey along grooves in the lizard’s teeth.</p>
      <p>The venom can be fatal to small mammals but rarely in humans. However, a painful swelling is common along with sweating and a rapid fall in blood pressure. The venom has been found to contain several enzymes useful for manufacturing drugs in the treatment of diabetes, and scientists are continuing to look at whether the venom can be used in the treatment of other diseases. The beaded lizard's body length is 80 centimetres and can weigh up to 8 kilograms.
        You can find our beaded lizards in the zoo’s Reptile House.</p>

      <h3>Common box turtle: <br> Terrapene carolina</h3>
      <p>Box turtles have a brown shell with orange or yellow patterns.  When frightened, box turtles retract their head, tail and limbs into their shell and clamp it shut so they are completely enclosed in their shell.  They wait in this position until the threat is gone. This defence technique means that very few species can effectively prey on adult box turtles. The average box turtle can measure up to 30.4 centimetres</p>

      <h3>Jamaican boa: <br> Chilabothrus Subflavus</h3>        
      <p>The Jamaican boa is nocturnal, hunting for its prey at night. It uses its forked tongue to detect chemicals signals from the prey. It waits motionless and ambushes the prey by biting into the body with its needle like teeth. They then suffocate their prey in their body coils. Once the prey is dead it’s swallowed whole, headfirst. <br> Females select their mate in the breeding season by the smell of the mate. Females can give birth to up to 40 young in October. The Jamaican boa can be 1.5 – 2.3 metres in length and weigh up to 5 kilograms.</p>
