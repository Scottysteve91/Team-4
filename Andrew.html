  <h1>INVERTEBRATES</h1>
  <p>What's the biggest disadvantage of this category? Spiders! They're horrifying. Unfortunately, I can't focus on any other invertebrates. Only spiders. Get ready for a horror show.</p>

      <h3>Camel Spider</h3>

      <p><i>Literal screams.</i></p>
      <p>Look at this thing. Literal nightmares. Its scientific name is Galeodes arabs. I think we should just call it our impending doom. On the plus side, this guy looks like a Spider-Man symbol.</p>
      <p>Camel spiders became an Internet sensation during the Iraq war of 2003, when rumors of their bloodthirsty nature began to circulate online. Many tales were accompanied with photos purporting to show spiders half the size of a human. I told you. NIGHTMARES!</p>

      <h3>Japanese spider crab</h3>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Macrocheira_kaempferi.jpg" alt="horrifying spider crab">
      <p>Is it a spider? Is it a crab? Who cares, it's HORRIFYING.</p>
      <p>Its scientific name is Macrocheira kaempferi. Let's just call it the thing that creeps into your dreams and turns them to thick, inescapable pools of death (ok not really death but I'm being hyperbolic here, just roll with it).</p>
      <p>Japanese spider crabs live on the Pacific side of Japan as far south as Taiwan and at chilly depths ranging from 164 feet to as low as 1,640 feet. (They spawn at the shallower end of that spectrum.) They thrive in temperatures of about 50 degrees. So, good news! They'll never come here! Not until global warming heats up that is...</p>

      <h3>Atlantic horseshoe crab</h3>

      <p>Oh wow not a spider. That's neat. Nice break.</p>
      <p>Its scientific name is Limulus polyphemus. Most of us probably owe our lives to horseshoe crabs. Their blue, copper-based blood contains lysate, which reacts to bacterial toxins by clotting. Horseshoe crab blood has long been harvested to test everything from water to intravenous drugs for contamination. It's also key to making vaccines for diseases such as COVID-19. Crabs are returned to the wild afterward but the process may have a negative effect on spawning. So hey, not only are they not spiders, they do cool stuff too! Thanks Horseshoe crabs! </p>
