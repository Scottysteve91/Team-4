      <h3>Bali Starling</h3>
      <p>The Bali starling is the national bird of Bali. However, it is now only found in the Bali Barat National Park where the birds have to be guarded by armed personnel. The Bali starling is one of the rarest birds in the world. It can measure up to 25 centimetres long and it can weight up to 90 grams.</p>
      <p>This stunning bird was only discovered in 1912 by Baron Rothschild (which is why it is sometimes referred to as the Rothschild’s mynah or the Bali mynah). However, over the last 100 years the Bali starling has been hunted to near extinction. As well as suffering from man’s interference with its habitat, it has also been widely trapped as a cage bird. In 2001 there were only six birds left in the wild but after conservation efforts this number has managed to increase but the population is still very low.</p>

      <h3>Von der Decken’s hornbill</h3>
      <p>Von der Decken’s hornbills are highly curious birds that are well accustomed to being around humans.  They tend to be very vocal throughout the day while communicating with one another.  Hornbills nest in large holes in hollow trees. The pair will seal the female inside the nest, with a mud and saliva wall that dries hard in the African sun.  A small hole is all that is left so that the male can hunt and pass food to the female and chicks.  She will only leave this nest once all of the chicks are fully fledged.</p>
      <p>The average hornbill can be up to 35 centimetres long. It can weigh up to 212 grams.</p>

      <h3>White-breasted barn owl</h3>        
      <p>Although no longer commonly seen, the barn owl is still a well-known bird within Ireland. It plays an important part in the history and folklore of the country as it is believed that the barn owls territorial screech was responsible for the legends of the banshee. The average barn owl can be up to 39 centimetres (cm) long. Their wingspan can be up to 95cm and they can weigh up to 350 grams.</p>
      <p>Barns owls nest in ruined or derelict buildings, such as rural barns and, occasionally, hollow cavities in mature trees. The barn owl is mostly white with yellow and tawny markings and has a distinctive heart-shaped face. Barn owls have low-light vision to help them find prey moving in grassland in the dead of night. They also have soft, downy feathers which muffle their movement during flight to allow them to hunt silently.</p>

        <h3>Java sparrow</h3>        
        <p>This finch was originally native to Java and Bali, in Indonesia. However, this bird has been a popular cage bird for centuries and the Java sparrow has now become established in many parts of the world, from Asia to Australia, Africa and North America. Trade in the bird is now banned except in a few countries such as China, Japan and Taiwan.</p>
